# mssql-server-express-windows

This is a copy of the dockerfile from https://github.com/Microsoft/mssql-docker/tree/master/windows/mssql-server-windows-express, with a healthcheck added in.

It was originally added as a PR - https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/pull/106 - but not merged as Microsoft was implementing something similar. At this point (approx 6 months later), it still hasn't dropped.
